[Tobias V. Langhoff's Guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator) that gave me clearer explanation on concepts that I didn't fully understand, without giving everything away. Display opcode got my head in a whirlwind but his explanation was great. 
[Laurence Muller](https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) if really didn't understand something/was new to it (graphics etc.)
